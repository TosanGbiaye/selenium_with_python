#loop statements: while loop
# while-loop is used to iterate over a block of code repeatedly until a given condition returns false.
# while loop syntax: while condition: # body_of_while
a = 1
while a<=10:
    print(a)
    a=a+1    #This is the termination statement for while loop as it adds + 1 to a until a becomes 11 and the condition turns false n terminate the iteration, ortherwise it will be a continous non stop iteration
